### Topics to include (first year specific)

1. ~~Registering on Student Center~~
2. ~~TA training dates heads up~~
3. Booking CAM rooms for office hours
4. ~~Course requirements~~ + recommendations
5. ~~Minor requirements~~ + example minors
6. Desk signup advice
7. Mentoring program?
8. Summer Funding/Finding an advisor/Finding an internship


### TA Training

If you will be TAing in the Fall (<span style="color:green">TODO: check with Phil who exactly is required to go, as well as the dates for this year</span>.) you are required to attend the math department's TA training session **in person** the week before the semester starts. In general, anyone not on a fellowship is TAing (look at your offer letter), but if you are unsure, you can email Phil Rusher to check. 

(This is mostly being included here so that you don't book a flight for the day before classes start and need to move it later.)

### Registering for Courses

Go to [Cornell Student Essentials](https://studentessentials.cornell.edu/) scroll down and click on "Student Center".
![Screenshot of Student Essentials Page](/images/studentEssentialsScreenshot.png)
Once you've logged in, click "enroll" under the "Academics" heading and select the appropriate term (Fall 20XX). Add any classes you are interested in to you shopping cart and then proceed to confirm enrollment.

#### Notes:

- During your first semester you cannot register until the graduate student open enrollment date. You can find this date by clicking "term information" near the top of the page.

- You are ***highly*** encouraged to register for significantly more courses than you intend to take. Register for anything that interests you and then drop to a reasonable number after attending each class once or twice.
- Note sure what to register for? See [Course Requirements](#course-requirements) and [Course Recommendations](#course-recommendations).


### Course Requirements

There are three sets of course requirements that you need to satisfy:
1. CAM course requirements
2. Math minor requirements
3. Minor requirements for another relevant field (of your choosing)

The Math minor requirements are well documented [here](https://math.cornell.edu/math-minor-and-math-concentration), but at a high level you will need to take four PhD level courses in the math department, with two of them taken for a letter grade and passed with at least a B-.

#### CAM Course Requirements

CAM requires you to take at least 8 graded courses satisfying the following:
1. One course in computational methods
2. Seven additional courses spanning at least three of:
    - Mathematical Analysis
    - Differential Equations & Dynamical Systems
    - Stochastic Methods
    - Optimization & Discrete Mathematics
    - Algorithms & Complexity
    - Algebra & Logic

At least three of the 8 courses must be numbered 6000 or above. These requirements are documented [here](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam/academics/phd-program/requirements).

#### Additional Minor Requirement

This is the most flexible of the three requirements since you get to choose your own minor. Unfortunately, there does not exist a cohesive list of available minors, nor do all minors have well documented requirements. The only thing that is certain is that if your minor committee member is willing to sign off on it, then it is okay.

Here is a list of common minors for CAM students:
1. Computer Science
    - Has well documented [requirements](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/minor)
    - Requires 4 CS courses
2. ORIE
3. Statistics
    - Has well documented [requirements](https://stat.cornell.edu/academics/phd/phd-minor-statistics)
    - Requires 5 courses
4. Computational Science and Engineering
    - Flexible requirements (and they are not specified on the [minor page](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/academics/fields-of-study/field/computational-science-and-engineering-minor/))


#### Final Note

We are allowed to "double dip" courses between requirements (as long as your committee members are okay with it). Thanks to this fact, it is usually possible to complete all of your requirements having taken only 8 courses, but doing so may require some planning. There is no benefit to doing this other than being done with course requirements sooner, which can be a pro or con depending on your own preferences.
